# Socium

Socium is my social project to fix wrong (and right too) behavior of car owners.
The idea is to store all information about cars, all mishaps, traffic violations
and so on.
This information will be accessible for all users. They can check history
of any car e.g.before buying for example or for car insurance companies
(make some sales for careful drivers or higher price for bad one).

All processes of data collection and validation lie on users. If some car owner
or maybe pedestrian witnessed some violation he add photo or video of target car where
license plate are available to read. Then other users can vote if violation is
fake or true. Users who create more truly reports have higher rating and their
reviews and reports have more weight by final calculation.
